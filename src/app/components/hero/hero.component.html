      The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic
      Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers
      undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our website
      exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and
      information sharing. It functions as a wikiâ€”all members of the School of
      Art community have the ability to add new, and edit most existing content.
